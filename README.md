# Simulated Annealing for Traveling Salesman Problem

This is a library that makes use of the Simulated Annealing 
algorithm to obtain an approximate solution to the 
Traveling Salesman Problem. To see an example of the use of 
this library, you can look at the notebook 
[examples.ipynb](./notebook_examples/examples.ipynb)

The kernels implemented in this library were obtained from the reference 
[A Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Travelling
Salesman Problem with Three Neighbor Generation
Structures](https://hal.science/hal-01962049/document)
